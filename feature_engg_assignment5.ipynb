    "The Pearson correlation coefficient (also known as Pearson's r) is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship."

The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is approximately 0.9. This high positive value indicates a strong positive linear relationship. In this case, we can interpret it as follows: As the amount of time students spend studying increases, their final exam scores tend to increase as well."
